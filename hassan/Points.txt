CSS Styling
- Background:
  - Adds a background image using the `url('your-image-path.jpg')` property (to be replaced with the actual image path).
  - Styles ensure the image scales appropriately with `background-size: cover` and remains centered.
- Login Container:
  - Sets a maximum width for compactness.
  - Adds a semi-transparent white background (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)`) for contrast.
  - Includes rounded corners (`border-radius: 8px`) for a modern look and a subtle shadow effect for depth.
- Login Header:
  - Aligns the title in the center with bold styling and a neutral color theme for readability.
- Interactive Links:
  - Styled to enhance visibility, with hover effects (underline on hover).

JavaScript Functionality
- Form Validation:
  - Prevents the default form submission behavior using `event.preventDefault()`.
  - Checks that both the username and password fields are filled.
  - Ensures the username has a minimum of 3 characters and the password has at least 6.
  - Displays alerts to guide the user based on validation outcomes.
- User Interaction:
  - Real-time validation alerts provide immediate feedback to users.

 Integration and Customization
1. Background Image:

2. Styling Adjustments:
   - Customize the CSS in the `<style>` section to align with specific branding or design preferences.
3. Extended Functionality:
